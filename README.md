# code-sketches
This repository is my digital workshop for coding experiments and unfinished ideas. It's a living collection where I tinker with algorithms, build data structures from scratch, and test out random hypotheses. Here, the focus is on the process of learning and exploration, not on production-ready code.

· 🧪 Experiments: Weird ideas and "what if?" scenarios brought to life in code.
· 🏗️ Reinventing the Wheel: Building things from scratch just for the fun of it.
· 🎨 Creative Coding: Visual, auditory, or just plain strange coding projects.
· 🤹 Code Juggling: Snippets, tricks, and hacks that don't belong anywhere else.
